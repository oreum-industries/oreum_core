# NOTES:
#  + Creates a virtual env for project development
#  + Require running on Apple Silicon ARM64 (NOT Intel x86 AMD64 CPU via Rosetta2)
#  + Install with mamba via Makefile, there's also a fuller set of deps to be
#    installed by pip in the pyproject.toml
#  + numpy not strictly needed here because it's brought in by pymc but because
#    we're explcit about BLAS/LAPACK from acccelerate, then also numpy.
#    also see https://numpy.org/install/ and https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/24053
#  + libblas, libcblas, liblapack, not strictly needed here but we want to be
#    explcit about forcing BLAS to use Accelerate
#  + pooch and scipy-tests required because conda-forge scipy (brought in by pymc)
#    doesnt contain tests
