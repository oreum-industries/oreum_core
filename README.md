## 1. Description and Scope

This is an ever-growing package of core tools for use on client projects by
Oreum Industries.

+ Uses scienfitic Python stack (`numpy`, `scipy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`,
  `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, etc) for EDA, data manipulation, basic ML etc
+ Enables Bayesian modelling workflow in R&D and Production (`pymc`, `pytensor`,
  `arviz`, etc)
+ Also includes utilities for text cleaning, sql scripting, file handling etc


This package **is**:

+ A work in progress (v0.y.z) and liable to breaking changes and inconvenience
  to the user
+ Solely designed for ease of use and rapid development by employees of
  Oreum Industries, and selected clients with guidance

This package **is not**:

+ Intended for public usage and will not be supported for public usage
+ Intended for contributions by anyone not an employee of Oreum Industries,
  and unsolicitied contributions will not be accepted.

+ See `LICENCE.md` for licensing and copyright details
+ See `CONTRIBUTORS.md` for list of contributors
+ This uses a logger named `'oreum_core'`, feel free to incorporate or ignore
+ Hosting:
  + Source code repo on [GitHub](https://github.com/oreum-industries/oreum_core)
  + Source code release on [GitHub](https://github.com/oreum-industries/oreum_core/releases)
  + Package release on [PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/oreum_core)



## 2. Instructions to Create Dev Environment

For local development on MacOS

### 2.0 Pre-requisite installs via `homebrew`

1. Install Homebrew, see instuctions at [https://brew.sh](https://brew.sh)
2. Install `direnv`, `git`, `git-lfs`, `graphviz`

```zsh
$> brew update && upgrade
$> brew install direnv git git-lfs graphviz
```

### 2.1 Git clone the repo

Assumes `git`, `git-lfs` and `direnv` installed as above

```zsh
$> git clone https://github.com/oreum-industries/oreum_core
$> cd oreum_core
```
Then allow `direnv` on MacOS to automatically run file `.envrc` upon directory open


### 2.2 Create virtual environment and install dev packages

Notes:

+ We use `conda` virtual envs controlled by `mamba` (quicker than `conda`)
+ We install packages using `miniforge` (sourced from the `conda-forge` repo)
  wherever possible and only use `pip` for packages that are handled better by
  `pip` and/or more up-to-date on [pypi](https://pypi.org)
+ Packages might not be the very latest because we want stability for `pymc`
  which is usually in a state of development flux
+ See [cheat sheet of conda commands](https://conda.io/docs/_downloads/conda-cheatsheet.pdf)
+ The `Makefile` creates a dev env and will also download and preinstall
  `miniforge` if not yet installed on your system


#### 2.2.1 Create the dev environment

From the dir above `oreum_core/` project dir:

```zsh
$> make -C oreum_core/ dev
```

This will also create some files to help confirm / diagnose successful installation:

+ `dev/install_log/blas_info.txt` for the `BLAS MKL` installation for `numpy`
+ `dev/install_log/pipdeptree[_rev].txt` lists installed package deps (and reversed)
+ `LICENSES_THIRD_PARTY.md` details the license for each package used


#### 2.2.2 (Optional best practice) Test successful installation of dev environment

From the dir above `oreum_core/` project dir:

```zsh
$> make -C oreum_core/ test-dev-env
```

This will also add files `dev/install_log/[numpy|scipy].txt` which detail
successful installation (or not) for `numpy`, `scipy`


#### 2.2.3 (Useful during env install experimentation): To remove the dev environment

From the dir above `oreum_core/` project dir:

```zsh
$> make -C oreum_core/ uninstall
```

### 2.3 Code Linting & Repo Control

#### 2.3.1 Pre-commit

We use [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com) to run a suite of automated tests
for code linting & quality control and repo control prior to commit on local
development machines.

+ Precommit is already installed by the `make dev` command (which itself calls
`pip install -e .[dev]`)
+ The pre-commit script will then run on your system upon `git commit`
+ See this project's `.pre-commit-config.yaml` for details


#### 2.3.2 Github Actions

We use [Github Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows) aka
Github Workflows to run:

1. A suite of automated tests for commits received at the origin (i.e. GitHub)
2. Publishing to PyPi upon creating a GH Release

+ See `Makefile` for the CLI commands that are issued
+ See `.github/workflows/*` for workflow details
