# Installation Notes:
#  + This package is intended to be installed via a git+ egg
#    e.g. this line would appear in a `pip_requirements.txt` file
#    `git+https://github.com/oreum-industries/oreum_core.git@v0.3.0#egg=oreum_core`
#  + We further intend this pip install is within a pre-created conda env
#  + The parent conda env needs to have installed the requirements shown in
#    this repos `condaenv_oreum_core.yml` file
#  + This ensures that we get the correct `pymc3` and `pymc-theano` installs,
#    see: https://github.com/pymc-devs/pymc/wiki/Installation-Guide-(MacOS)
#  + Note that pymc3 itself installs several scientific packages that you might
#    otherwise expect to see listed here: `arviz`, `pandas`, `scipy`, so we
#    rely on https://github.com/pymc-devs/pymc/blob/main/requirements.txt
#    unless we have to hard-pin for compatibility (not yet needed)
#  + Lower-pinned packages to 3-level version >= a.b.c
